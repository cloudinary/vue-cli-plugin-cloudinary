## 🛠️ Installing

**Ignore step 1,2 if you already have vue-cli 3.0 installed and created a project using vue-cli 3.0**

1. Install [Vue-CLI 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
2. Create Vue project with Vue-CLI by

```bash
vue create <your-app-name>
```

3. Navigate to your created project folder

```bash
cd <your-app-name>
```

4. Add Cloudinary SDK for Vue

```bash
vue add cloudinary
```

5. Set up your cloudName and pick the components to use (or use all 😃)

![Set up with cloudName and options](http://bit.ly/2WSKTf0)

6. A `cloudinary.js` file will be added to your `src` directory, same level with your `main.js` file. Feel free to customize it if you like. And have fun with Cloudinary! 🤟
